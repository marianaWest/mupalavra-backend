This is a web application that allows the researchers at the Paranaense Museum in Brazil to enter new words to a database, and then added to the Mupalavra game, based on Wordle.   
  - The researcher enters a word related to the Museum collection and its description.  
  - The word and description are saved on a Mongo database. 
  - The word is accessed by the Mupalavra game.  
  - The researcher can delete the word and description, and "like" if they agree with the new entry suggested by another researcher.
